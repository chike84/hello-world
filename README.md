# hello-world
I am getting into the GitHub world to see what i can learn and do with this resource and community
I am a 4+ years resident of the bay area, by way of Houston, by way of Philadelphia, by way of Lagos, Nigeria. I have a background in Management Information Systems, with about 8 years experience in Business analysis and 2 years of project management. I recently earned a scrum master certification and i am now a Scrum Master in FinTech. I am pretty light on software development skills, so i am looking to gradually learn and really be able to hold my own in this field.
